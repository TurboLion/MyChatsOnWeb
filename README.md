# MyChatsOnWeb

I've started this project because I wanted to be able to see my missed messages
in Skype chat, but I didn't want to have the Android app open on my smartphone.

As a result I've used Skype4Py and about after 8 hours of work I came up with
this little Python script. It connects to your instance of Skype, gets the
latest chats and missed messages and displays them on a web page, which runs on
an instance of CherryPy's server.

Written for Python 2.7, developed and tested on Win 8.1 and released under the
Modified BSD License.

In this project I've used the following:
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Skype4Py](https://github.com/awahlig/skype4py)
